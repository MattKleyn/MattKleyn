Hey howzit, I'm Matthew

**Lore:**
  - Am South African
  - BSc Construction Studies and BSc(Hon) Construction Management from The University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.
  - From 2016 to 2023 was permenantely employed by one of the biggest contractors in South Africa, and worked on various construction sites -commercial office space, malls, apartments and a lodge - and in various areas - from Midrand, to Cape Town, and eventually in Lesotho.
  - Resigned in 2023 due to personal reasons and took a sabbatical to explore new things.
  - At the beginning of 2025 I finally started my journey into tech, initially starting with Python, and eventually through various web development technologies. 

**What I'm working on:**
  - Dev Frog Blog – a developer journal and case study platform for learning, by the people, for the people.
    - Phase 3: Implementation of PostgreSQL database, user profile and authentication, cookies and sessions.
  - My portfolio site, an ever evolving site to showcase what I got.
  - Reach out via Github or LinkendIn if you would like to review any of my code or help out with mentorship, I would appreciate it.

**Philosophy:**
  I document my process through developer journaling and case studies, framing each project as a learning arc. 
  I value semantic structure, minimalist design, and systems thinking. Due to me being mostly self-taught I place an emphasis on deep understanding of what I do.

  - Dev Frog Blog - a phased CRUD app with JSON data persistance
  - Portfolio Site - a static multi-page website to display my stuff, https://mattkleyn.github.io/portfolio-site/

**Near-term plans:**
  **Learn and improve as a fullstack dev**
  - Improve my designers eye, seamless UI/UX and accessibility integration
  - React
  - Machine learning and AI development
  - Java (medium term)

**Longer-term goal:**
Fullstack software designer and developer with deep knowledge of machine learning integration.
