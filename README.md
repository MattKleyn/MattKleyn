Hey howzit ðŸ‘‹

Lore:
  - Am South African
  - BSc Construction Studies and BSc(Hon) Construction Management from The University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.
  - Permanantely employed by one of the biggest contractors in South Africa from 2016 to 2023 and worked on various construction sites - from Midrand, to Cape Town, and eventually in Lesotho.
  - Resigned due to personal reasons and took a sabbatical.
  - I ended up finally starting my tech journey during this sabbatical as I have had a few ideas rattling around my head for awhile. 

Near-term plans:
  - Learning Python through the ZTM Academy, still have some ways to go but have a grasp of the basics and a few advanced coding paradigms such as OOp and functional programming.
  - Still need to dive into datastructures and algorythms (seems to be a popular topic).
  - My current assignment is to code the backend for a secure password checker. It utilises an API from 'Pwnedpasswords.com', to check if a password input has been leaked. In doing this securly, it uses the SHA1 hashing algorythm to encode the password, however only sending the first few letters of the hash value. It also recieves all the leaked password with the same hash value beginning, to check them against the remaining hasvalue of the password that wasnt sent. THis is sothat in the event the request is intercepted, then only a part of the hashvalue is leaked instead of the entire hash value or the password itself. The code lastly informs the user whether the password (by checking the beginning and remainder of the hash value) is a security risk. The passowrds are inputs by using the terminal and then running the python script.
  - I want to dive into machine learning and AI development (will need to suppliment with some Mathematical concepts).
  - Learn front end tech stack, HTML, CSS, Javascript and node.js (I already have a basic working knowledge of Figma and Webflow).
  - Learn SQL
  - I have not yet decided whether I want to get into web dev, SWE, or data analysis. I belive the above will give me the basic competencies in order to branch out in any of those directions.
  - At the end of the day I at least want to create the apps to solve a few of my own problems, and if I can get hired and learn from more seasoned professionals then that will make it alot easier.

A few notes and random facts about me:
  - At some point I also want to learn how to make my own mods for Fallout 4 and Skyrim, because who knows when we will actually get the Edlerscrolls 6 (and if it will be a Starfield or Fallout 76 release version dumpsterfire or not)...I mean Skyrim was realeased in 2011...so yeah.
- Currently exploring the world of Punk Rock, if you enjoy S.O.A.D, then check out The Dead Kennedys. If you enjoy Aussie humour, then check out The Chats.
- I might be young, dumb, and broke, but at least I can use python to send myself emails.
