Hey howzit, I'm Matthew

**Lore:**
  - Am South African
  - BSc Construction Studies and BSc(Hon) Construction Management from The University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.
  - From 2016 to 2023 permenantely employed by one of the biggest contractors in South Africa, and worked on various construction sites - from Midrand, to Cape Town, and eventually in Lesotho.

**Philosophy:**
  I document my process through developer journaling and case studies, framing each project as a learning arc. 
  I value semantic structure, minimalist design, and systems thinking. Due to me being mostly self-taught I place an emphasis on deep understanding of what I do.
