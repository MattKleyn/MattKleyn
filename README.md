Hey howzit ðŸ‘‹

So long story short, I studied at and recieved my BSc Construction Studies and BSc(Hon) Construction Management degrees from The University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Thereafter I was hired by one of the biggest contractors in South Africa and worked on various construction sites - from Midrand, to Cape Town, and eventually in Lesotho, during my 7 years of permanant employment.

I resigned due to personal reasons and took a sabatical. I ended up finally starting my tech journey as I have had a few ideas rattling around my head for awhile. 

This is one more step on my journey to creating software solutions to fill gaps in my personal capacity, and hopefully i can execute it weel enough to help someone else.

A few notes and random facts about me:
- I am currently in the final stages of my Python online course from the ZTM Academy, and my current assignment is coding a secure password checker that utilises an API from PwnedPasswords.com, hashes the password according to SHA1 algorythm, splits and return how many times the password has been 'pwned'. The aim is to create a secure checker that even if intercepted by cyber pirates then only a portion of the hash value is available.

- I also have a basic working knowledge of Figma and Webflow, however I havent utilised them since 2023.

- After I have a good grasp of Python code for backend development, I will then dive into learning some front end tech. namely html, CSS, and Javascript.

- At some point I also want to learn how to make my own mods for Fallout 4 and Skyrim, because who knows when we will actually get the Edlerscrolls 6...I mean Skyrim was realeased in 2011...so yeah.

- I might be young, dumb, and broke, but at least I can use python to send myself emails.

- Currently exploring the world of Punk Rock, if you enjoy S.O.A.D, then check out The Dead Kennedys. If you enjoy Aussie humour, then check out The Chats.
